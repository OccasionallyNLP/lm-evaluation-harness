The application of a force. Any time an object changes motion, a force has been applied. In what ways can this happen? Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball. This requires only a very small force. \nQuestion: What do you apply to an object to make it move or stop?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " A force\nIs the answer correct? no"}}, "resps": [[["-15.950889192521572", "False"]], [["-20.200889192521572", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-15.950889192521572", "False"], ["-20.200889192521572", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc"], "doc_hash": "8a9bfbbbbcb130d16bd93c37b41984fb322c917cb153e4fb96703be5a74f418e", "prompt_hash": "b7e6daca25bc0fed41db9fa4b32dda09c5a3ff98d51c4f885aa2ba3afd130971", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 0.0}
